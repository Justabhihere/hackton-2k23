- Create a Python application with Flask or Django that uses Tweepy and TextBlob for sentiment analysis. This application exposes an API route for sentiment analysis.

- Your Node.js backend application sends text data to the Python API route via HTTP requests.

- The Python application processes the text data using Tweepy and TextBlob, performs sentiment analysis, and sends back the results as a response to the Node.js application.
